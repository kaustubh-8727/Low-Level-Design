# 🧵 In-Memory Message Streaming System (Java)

This project is a **Low-Level Design (LLD)** implementation of a simplified **in-memory message streaming system**, inspired by Kafka’s core architecture — including **topics, partitions, producers, consumers, and message notifications**.

The system supports multiple producers and consumers, maintains message order within partitions, and demonstrates thread-safe message queues using **`LinkedBlockingQueue`**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 **Topics and Partitions**
  - Each topic can have multiple partitions.
  - Messages within a partition are strictly ordered.

- 👨‍💻 **Producers**
  - Producers can publish messages to topics.
  - Partition selection is random (can be customized later).

- 👥 **Consumers**
  - Consumers are registered and assigned to partitions.
  - Notification service delivers messages to assigned consumers.

- ⚙️ **Thread-Safe Queues**
  - Uses `LinkedBlockingQueue` to ensure safe concurrent message passing.

- 🔔 **Notification Service**
  - Handles partition-to-consumer assignment.
  - Simulates delivery of messages from partitions to consumers.

## 🧩 Class Responsibilities

| Class | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **Message** | Represents a message with ID, content, and timestamp. |
| **Partition** | Thread-safe message queue maintaining order. |
| **Topic** | Contains multiple partitions. |
| **TopicService** | Creates and manages topics. |
| **Producer** | Represents a message producer assigned to a topic. |
| **ProducerService** | Handles message publishing and partition selection. |
| **Consumer** | Processes incoming messages. |
| **ConsumerService** | Registers consumers and manages delivery. |
| **NotificationService** | Assigns consumers to partitions and triggers notifications. |
| **PartitionChooser** | Chooses which partition to publish messages to. |
| **KafkaLowLevelDesign (Main)** | Demonstrates the end-to-end workflow. |
