# Low-Level Design Repository

This repository offers a comprehensive collection of Low-Level Design solutions for various real-world applications. Each solution showcases a different design pattern, accompanied by practical code implementations to demonstrate how these patterns can be effectively applied in software development.

## Design Patterns and Use Cases:

- **State Design Pattern:** 
  - *Application:* Vending Machine
  - *Description:* Implements state transitions within a vending machine, managing different states such as selection, payment, and dispensing.

- **Observer Design Pattern:** 
  - *Application:* Online Shopping App Notification System
  - *Description:* Manages a notification system where observers (e.g., users) are updated about changes in their subscribed items (e.g., price drops, stock availability).

- **Composite Design Pattern:** 
  - *Application:* File Search in a Directory
  - *Description:* Facilitates searching for files within a directory structure, treating files and directories uniformly as components of a tree.

- **Command Design Pattern:** 
  - *Application:* Text Editor (Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo Operations)
  - *Description:* Implements command-based operations in a text editor, allowing for actions like cut, copy, paste, and undo to be encapsulated as objects.

- **Decorator Design Pattern:** 
  - *Application:* Coffee/Tea Ordering System
  - *Description:* Adds dynamic add-ons to coffee or tea orders (e.g., milk, sugar, flavors), showcasing flexible and reusable designs.

- **Visitor Design Pattern:** 
  - *Application:* E-Commerce System
  - *Description:* Implements functionalities such as adding promotional discounts, tax calculations, and shipping cost calculations across various product categories.

- **Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern:** 
  - *Application:* Logger System in Java
  - *Description:* Establishes a chain of loggers to handle different levels of logging (e.g., info, debug, error) based on the severity of the messages.

- **Builder Design Pattern:** 
  - *Application:* Vehicle Assembly System
  - *Description:* Allows for the assembly of different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks) by sharing common components and customizing specific features.

- **And Many More...**
  - The repository continues to grow with additional design patterns and implementations, offering a rich resource for understanding and applying design principles in software development.

## Purpose:
This repository serves as a valuable resource for developers, software engineers, and students looking to deepen their understanding of Low-Level Design principles and design patterns. Each example is crafted to provide clear, practical insights into how these patterns can be used to solve complex design challenges.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to this collection as it evolves.
